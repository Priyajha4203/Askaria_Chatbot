Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML)
About the Course
We have stepped into the future and by now most of us have heard about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. AI refers to machine intelligence which is programmed to imitate humans and their actions. It is a mimic of human intelligence for learning and problem-solving.
On the other hand, Machine Learning works on the principles of artificial intelligence. It involves the study of computer algorithms that imitate human behaviour and improve automatically through experience.
Aravali College of Engineering and Management, Faridabad, offers B. Tech in Computer Science (Artificial Learning and Machine Learning) which is an undergraduate program with advanced learning solutions imparting acquaintances of advanced inventions like machine learning, often called deep learning and artificial intelligence.
This specialization is designed to qualify students to build intelligent machines, software, or applications with a cutting-edge combination of machine learning, analytics, and visualization technologies. The main area of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is to program computers to use example data or experience to solve a specified problem. Many efficacious applications based on machine learning exist already, including systems that analyse previous sales data to predict customer behaviour (financial management), detect faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behaviour so that a task can be accomplished using minimum resources, and citation of knowledge from bioinformatics data.
This program deliberates AI methods based in unalike fields, including neural networks, signal processing, control, and data mining, to present an integrated treatment of machine learning problems and solutions.
Due to the cumulative demand for Artificial Intelligence, many AI courses have been started at various levels. However, Artificial Intelligence courses are still in the preliminary stages as it has been raised recently. The importance of AI grew in leaps and bounds in the past few years which is why, in terms of education, Artificial Intelligence is in quite a promising stage.
The possibilities in AI are enormous. It can range from building quantum computers to working as a software engineer researching neural networks, human-machine interfaces, or processing big data.
